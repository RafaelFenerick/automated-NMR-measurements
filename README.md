An automated system for performing Time-Domain NMR measurements in function of the temperature

## Description
Time-Domain Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (TDNMR) is a powerful method to characterize materials, widely used in chemical and food industry. Some TD-NMR methods depends on the performance of several signal acquisitions in different temperatures, which is a repetitive and time-consuming process. In this work we developed an automatization of the Minispec mq20 Bruker spectrometer, with the BVT3000 temperature control, building a software and hardware to realize TD-NMR experiments in function of the temperature and the calibration of the temperature in an automatic form. As an application example, the system was used to measure the melting process of paraffins and petroleum asphalt cement. The system was already used in several TD-NMR analysis, reported in the literature, and is currently working in NMR laboratories at the Institute of Physics of SÃ£o Carlos - IFSC/USP and at the PETROBRAS Research Center in Rio de Janeiro - CENPES/Rio.
